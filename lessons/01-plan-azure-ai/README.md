# Lesson 1 -- Choose Foundry services, models, and integration approach

Welcome! These are the hands-on demos for **Module 1** of the Microsoft Press video
course *Exam AI-103: Developing AI Apps and Agents on Azure*.

Module 1 is about **four decisions**: which model, which Foundry service, which
retrieval method, and which memory/tool/knowledge integration. The main demo here
makes **all four** concrete in a single small agent -- the way AI-103 actually ships.

## The main demo: one grounded agent, all four decisions

`m01_agent_demo.py` builds **one** small Globomantics support agent with the
**Microsoft Agent Framework** on Microsoft Foundry (the current, GA path -- the
classic `create_agent`/thread/run API is deprecated and retires in 2027). Every
Lesson-1 decision shows up as one ingredient, exactly like the slide that says
"an agent is memory + tools + knowledge, with guardrails":

| Decision (LO) | How the demo makes it | In the code |
|---|---|---|
| **LO1 -- choose a model** | the agent reasons with your `FOUNDRY_MODEL` (a capable LLM) | `FOUNDRY_MODEL` |
| **LO2 -- choose a service** | the **Agents service** via `FoundryChatClient`, not stateless chat | `FoundryChatClient(...)` |
| **LO3 -- choose retrieval** | grounds answers on a knowledge file (managed vector store) | `get_file_search_tool(...)` |
| **LO4 -- memory + tools + knowledge** | a **session** (memory), a custom **@tool**, the knowledge source, and an **approval gate** (guardrail) | `create_session()`, `@tool`, `tools=[...]` |

It runs a two-turn conversation: turn 1 forces the agent to **read the policy
(retrieval)** and **open a refund ticket (tool)**; turn 2 omits the customer's name
so the agent must **remember it from the session (memory)**.

## Bonus: `model_bakeoff.py` -- an LO1 spotlight

Want to go deep on just the model choice? `model_bakeoff.py` sends the same prompt to
a **flagship LLM** (`gpt-5.1`) and a **small model** (`phi-4`) and prints a
side-by-side scoreboard of latency, tokens, and answers -- the "task fit beats brand
name" lesson, proven with a stopwatch.

## What you will need

- A **Microsoft Foundry** project with a **deployed chat model** (e.g. `gpt-5.1`).
- A **basic agent setup** in that project (managed storage + vector store for file search).
- The **Azure CLI**, signed in with `az login` (auth is keyless -- no API keys).
- **Python 3.10 - 3.13** (the Agent Framework GA wheels do not yet publish for 3.14).

## Environment variables

Both demos read their config from the environment (never hardcoded). Copy
`.env.example` to `.env`, then fill in your values. Each variable is documented in
`.env.example` with a one-line note on where to get it.

| Variable | Used by | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` | both | Foundry portal -> project -> Overview -> Endpoint |
| `FOUNDRY_MODEL` | agent demo | deployment **name** of your chat model (e.g. `gpt-5.1`) |
| `FLAGSHIP_DEPLOYMENT` | bake-off | deployment **name** of your flagship LLM (e.g. `gpt-5.1`) |
| `SLM_DEPLOYMENT` | bake-off | deployment **name** of your small model (e.g. `phi-4`) |

## Run it

Run both demos straight from this folder. Pick the block for your shell. The sequence
is the same: create and activate a **virtual environment**, install dependencies, sign
in **keyless** with `az login`, create your `.env`, then run the two scripts.

**Windows (PowerShell 7):**

```powershell
cd lessons/01-plan-azure-ai
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
az login
Copy-Item .env.example .env   # then edit .env with your Foundry values
python m01_agent_demo.py      # the main demo -- all four LOs
python model_bakeoff.py       # the LO1 spotlight
```

**macOS / Linux (bash):**

```bash
cd lessons/01-plan-azure-ai
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
az login
cp .env.example .env          # then edit .env with your Foundry values
python m01_agent_demo.py      # the main demo -- all four LOs
python model_bakeoff.py       # the LO1 spotlight
```

The bake-off also takes a custom prompt:

```bash
python model_bakeoff.py --prompt "Summarize the CAP theorem in one sentence."
```

## What you will see (agent demo, illustrative)

```
LO1  model       : gpt-5.1  (capable LLM for agent reasoning)
LO2  service     : Microsoft Foundry Agents (Agent Framework), keyless auth
LO3  retrieval   : file-search grounding over a managed vector store
LO4  integration : thread (memory) + custom tool + knowledge source + approval gate
========================================================================
User: I'm Dana Lee, a Premium customer. I bought 22 days ago for $80 ...
Agent: You're within the 30-day Premium window, so you qualify for a full refund.
       I've opened ticket RF-3175 for $80.00.
User: Remind me which plan I'm on and what refund you just queued for me.
Agent: You're on the Premium plan, and I queued an $80.00 full refund (ticket RF-3175).
```

## How this maps to the exam

The agent demo touches every Lesson-1 objective group at once: model selection,
service selection, retrieval/indexing, and agent memory/tool/knowledge integration.
When an exam stem describes "an agent that answers from internal docs and takes an
action," you should now see the building blocks behind it.
