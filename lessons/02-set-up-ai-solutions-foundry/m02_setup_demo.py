M02 demo -- one real Foundry model deployment that makes ALL FOUR Lesson 2 decisions.

AI-103 Lesson 2 ("Set up AI solutions in Foundry") is four choices about *setting up*
infrastructure and deployments. Rather than four disconnected snippets, this builds the
ONE artifact those choices produce -- a real, running model deployment -- then tears it
back down. Everything is keyless (Microsoft Entra ID via DefaultAzureCredential): no API
keys anywhere, exactly the way AI-103 wants you deploying in production and in CI/CD.

Each decision maps onto the lesson's own slides (and onto an exam "tell"):

  LO1  DESIGN INFRASTRUCTURE ...... connect keyless to a *hub-less Foundry project* plus
                                    its parent Foundry (Cognitive Services) account -- the
                                    default Foundry model, no AI Hub required.
  LO2  CHOOSE A DEPLOYMENT OPTION .. create the deployment with a chosen SKU (sku.name).
                                    GlobalStandard = pay-per-token shared capacity, the
                                    recommended starting point; swap to ProvisionedManaged
                                    for PTU, or GlobalBatch for async 50%-off jobs.
  LO3  CONFIGURE THE DEPLOYMENT .... pin the model version (versionUpgradeOption =
                                    NoAutoUpgrade) and attach a content-filter policy
                                    (raiPolicyName), then read both back and prove the
                                    deployment is live by calling it.
  LO4  INTEGRATE WITH CI/CD ........ the create call is an *idempotent upsert* -- re-running
                                    converges to the same desired state, just like the
                                    Bicep in ../../infra/ai103-core.bicep. DefaultAzureCredential
                                    resolves to OIDC federated identity in GitHub Actions,
                                    so the pipeline ships with zero stored secrets.

Two Azure planes are in play, and telling them apart is itself an exam skill:
  * CONTROL plane (azure-mgmt-cognitiveservices) CREATES/CONFIGURES the deployment. Needs a
    management role -- Cognitive Services Contributor (or Contributor) on the account.
  * DATA plane (azure-ai-projects) READS and CALLS it. Needs a Foundry data role -- Foundry
    User is enough. (Plain Owner/Contributor grant no data actions; that's a classic trap.)

Setup:  uv sync   (or: pip install -e .)   ;   az login   ;   copy .env.example to .env
Run:    uv run python m02_setup_demo.py            # create -> configure -> verify -> delete
        uv run python m02_setup_demo.py --dry-run  # print the exact spec, call nothing
        uv run python m02_setup_demo.py --keep      # leave the deployment standing

This file is also a VS Code notebook: the `# %%` markers open it in the Interactive Window
("Run Cell"), so it works with or without Jupyter -- no separate .ipynb to keep in sync.
