M01 demo -- Model Bake-Off: pick the right model for the job.

AI-103 Lesson 1 ("Choose Foundry services, models, and integration approach")
teaches one durable habit: TASK FIT beats brand name. This script proves it live.
It sends the SAME prompt to two models you have deployed in Microsoft Foundry -- a
flagship large language model (LLM) and a small language model (SLM) -- and prints a
side-by-side scoreboard of latency, token usage, and the answers themselves.

What you should see:
  * the SLM (for example, Phi-4) comes back faster and cheaper,
  * the flagship (for example, GPT-5.1) reasons a little deeper.
The "right" model is the one whose strengths match the workload in front of you,
not the biggest name on the leaderboard.

Auth is KEYLESS (Microsoft Entra ID via DefaultAzureCredential), which is the
AI-103 security posture -- no API keys live in this file. Run `az login` first.

Setup (see README.md and .env.example):
  uv sync
  az login
Run:
  uv run python model_bakeoff.py
  uv run python model_bakeoff.py --prompt "Summarize the CAP theorem in one sentence."
