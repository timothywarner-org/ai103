## 🔑 Environment & Configuration

- [x] Add a global `.env.sample` at the repo root (done)
- [ ] Add `.env.sample` files to lesson folders that require them
- [ ] Ensure all setup instructions referencing `.env.sample` are accurate

## 🧩 Demo Apps & Lesson Coverage

- [ ] Create or port demo apps for lessons currently missing them:
  - [ ] Lesson 1: Plan Azure AI Solutions
  - [ ] Lesson 2: Design AI Architectures
  - [ ] Lesson 7: Create Custom Computer Vision Models
  - [ ] Lesson 10: Build Conversational AI with Bots

  - [ ] Linting (e.g., ESLint, flake8)
  - [ ] Testing (unit/integration)
  - [ ] Security scanning (e.g., CodeQL, secret scanning)
- [ ] Document how to run and interpret CI results in the repo

## 🗂️ Resource Centralization & Hygiene
